Release Style
=============
hikari-expo follows the `semver <https://semver.org>`_ version guideline.

meaning:

``major`` releases are when the api (hikari) has breaking changes

``minor`` is for normal feature-length releases

.. note::

    due to the lack of major versions breaking changes can happen here.

``micro`` is for bug fixes only.
